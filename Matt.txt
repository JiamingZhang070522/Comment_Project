This semester in Data Science we covered the topics of csv file, debugging, and coding and began the study of recursion, which we will continue into the second semester. In addition to daily homework and frequent quizzes, we had two in-class unit tests, a cumulative final exam, and two projects, one on generating comment and one on modeling for SRP.
Matt, you have faced some challenges in this course scoring a 70, but please continue to work hard and check in with me. I would encourage checking in with me during office hours or before tests.
This semester, you showed particular strength on our learning outcome of 'effectively communicate programming solutions to others' when you had great teamwork with group on the collaborative projects. I was uniquely impressed by your ability and aptiude for this outcome, and I'm hoping you'll help your classmates get to the same level you're at.
On the other hand, you had some difficulty with our outcome of 'Design, document, implement and test solutions to programming problems' after you had troubles with creating efficient functions. I'd encourage you to reach out to me or your classmates for help figuring out this outcome, and to focus on improving here for the next semester.
You have only turn in a few assignment, is there a way I can help you next semester? I can provide you some advise on time management!
Please make sure to check in with me for absences.
